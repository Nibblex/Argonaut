"""Interface internationalization: current language, preference persistence
with QSettings and the strings themselves.

The strings live in locales/<code>.json, one file per interface language,
read the first time that language is asked for. English is the default and
acts as a fallback: if a language is missing a key, the English string is
used.

Next to them, locales/language_names.json holds the names of the
translation languages in each interface language, so "French" reads
"Francés" in a Spanish interface. Unlike the locale files that one is
generated, by tools/gen_language_names.py, and a code missing from it
keeps the English name the engine reports.
